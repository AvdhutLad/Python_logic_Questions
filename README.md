# Java Logic Questions

## Overview
This repository contains solutions to a wide range of **Java** logical coding problems. The problems range from basic to advanced levels and are aimed at improving problem-solving skills using Java.

The repository is a **work in progress**, and more solutions will be added over time as I continue solving new challenges.

## Sections
- **Basic**: Includes simple logical problems covering loops, conditionals, and basic data structures.
- **Intermediate**: Covers problems that involve arrays, strings, and common algorithms.
- **Advanced**: Contains complex problems involving recursion, dynamic programming, and advanced algorithmic challenges.
